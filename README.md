## 06 Weather Dashboard

In this app, the user enters the name of a city in the search field, then clicks the search button. The app will display the current weather conditions in that city, including temperature, humidity, UV index, and a picture representing whether it is clear, cloudy, raining, etc. Additionally, a 5-day forecast for that city is displayed below the current conditions showing similar information (predicted at 12:00 PM on each day).
